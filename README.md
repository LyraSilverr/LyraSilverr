<p align="center">
I don't do well with personal questions, friends or not, especially if we just met as I may just say "I don't feel comfortable answering." Or something close to that, I just don't like sharing too much, or much about myself, really. (⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠) i also might go quiet/not talk much if discussing personal things around me, my life isn't that interesting, pls don't ask... (⁠・⁠_⁠・⁠;⁠) !
