Hello there! Here are some things to know before you interact if you are from Pony Town.

I'm not looking for more friends, but we can chat if you want! (As stated in the short description, I can be a bit awkward, but i swear i'm friendly!)

I don't do well with personal questions, especially if we just met as I may just say "I don't feel comfortable answering." Or something close to that, I just don't like sharing too much, or much about myself, really. (⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠) 

I'm usually around the marvel/DC area beside bakery now, don't come say hi!! /Half joking...

—————————————————————————

Here's what my status means!

🟢Online: I'm there, just sitting. Watching 👀. You can interact. i will respond immediately.

🌙Away and or sleeping: probably Afk doing something for a moment, will be back soon!

⛔Busy: Rarely use this, but if I am using this, I might not respond immediately since I am not looking at my phone.

🗨️Looking for chat: Never use this.

🎭Looking for roleplay: I never use this too.
